# Install the whole repo as a zip file, this can be done via click on "Code" in top right corner 
# Extract the zip file

# Open `fabric-installer-1.0.1.jar` (or `fabric-installer-1.0.1.exe` if you don't have java installed)
- Pick the client tab
- Pick `1.21.1` MC version
- Leave the Loader version alone
- Make sure you are at the right .minecraft folder
- Click on Install

# Once you finish the steps above
- Navigate to `C:\Users\<yourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`
- Drag and drop all jar files from the `client mods` folder into the `mods` folder in your `.minecraft` directory

# Time to test
- **Open your launcher to ensure it has the fabric launcher jar as the startup option**
- **Test if your fabric launcher and mods are working by logging into the Minecraft Server and observe any of the mods**
